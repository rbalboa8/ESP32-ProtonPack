Proton Pack Cycloton animation:

1. create a 1984 proton pack cyclotron lights animation. it should use pin 2 of the Arduino Nano. 5 ws2812 leds per cyclotron light and not use millis

2. add user variables to control the speed of the lights changing

3. identify that delay time as for the "84 cyclotron lights rotation speed"

4. change the speed to 1500 as default

5. each cyclotron light should ramp from off to on, back to off again over the declared cyclotronRotationSpeed

6. do not use the delay function

7. revert the code that did not work

8. create a 1984 proton pack cyclotron lights animation. it should use pin 2 of the Arduino Nano. user define the number of leds that make up each cyclotron light with a default of 5. ws2812 leds are used for the leds. the code should not use delays at all. the light pattern should take the first cyclotron light group, fade their brightness up from off to full brightness over a user defined 7500 milliseconds and fade back down for another user defined default of 7500 milliseconds back to off. then move on to the next light group. once the fourth light group is reached the sequence should repeat. each light group should be the red. indicate that the variable refer to the 1984 pack cyclotron lights animation

9. please remove all serial debugging code and dont add anymore without asking please

10. please change the default value of fadeUpTime and fadeDownTime to 1500
