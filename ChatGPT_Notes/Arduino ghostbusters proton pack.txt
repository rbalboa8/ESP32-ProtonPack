Arduino ghostbusters proton pack:

1. can you help me make an Arduino project to add electronics to a prop of the movie ghostbusters proton pack

2. I would like to work on this project a step at a time. first I would like to add cyclotron lights. these will be ws2812 leds controlled by a Arduino nano

3. can we change the code to allow the cyclotron animation we have created to run simultaneously with any other feature we add

4. also can we change the led pin to pin 2

5. can you update the whole code with the led pin change please

6. I have corrected the code myself, please use this now:

7. please remove the "additional feature" code

8. I would like to use a digital pin that is always being monitored. when the pin the toggle switch is connected to is high I want the led animation to stop

9. revert the code please

10. can you please add a user variable to define the number of leds used for each of the four cyclotron lights

11. can we also add a user defined variable for the direction of the lights. this should be clockwise or anti-clockwise and the default is clockwise

12. that did not work properly when running the leds in a anti-clockwise direction

13. that change worked perfectly. thank you. can we add a toggle switch on pin 7 that the code monitors in real time to change the led direction

14. the code appears to be using a momentary switch rather than a toggle switch. can we change the code so it assigns a low value to clockwise and a high value to anti-clockwise please

15. the leds are not changing direction when the toggle switch position is changed. the code should be monitoring the high/low state of the switch pin and changing direction every time the pin changes

16. the wiring has been tested and is good and the toggle switch is still not changing the led animation direction.

17. I can see via the serial output that we are getting double switch changes, meaning I see New direction: Clockwise and then imediatley New direction: Clockwise. the serial monitor is also showing me that the switch change is not being detected each time it is changed. similar to the effect you get when using delays instead of millis

18. I now see nothing on the serial monitor when the rocker switch is toggled

19. I have checked the wiring with a multimeter so it is fine

20. can we go back to this code:

21. can we add a user definable variable for the cyclotron lights speed. I want to use value from 1 to 20. 20 is the fastest speed

22. that's good. can we also add a user variable for the default speed please. I would also like the groups of leds that make up the 4 cyclotron lights to fade in and out before moving on to the next group. for this fade, can you add a user defined variable for the default speed and the minimum and maximum speeds. the minimum value for the fade should be 1 and the maximum 10. the default should be 5

23. the fade effect is not fading to off. can you please change this

24. that has fixed the issue with the leds not fading to off but I am not seeing any up and down fade

25. I am now getting the effect that the fade goes from off to full brightness and goes from maximum brightness to off. the effect should ramp from off to full brightness and then ramp back down to off. the fade should be performed over the time that the current cyclotron light is being animated. the fade speed should adjust over the time the cyclotron light is active so you can remove the user defined values

26. can we please change the way the speed of the cyclotron lights is handled. please remove the MAX_SPEED and MIN_SPEED variables. then add new variables that define the length of time each of the four cyclotron lights are on and the time gap until the next set of leds turn on. can you use the current animation as the initial default values for these new variables.

27. that was perfect. can we add to the code that controls the lights direction an instruction to clear all the cyclotron leds before starting the animation again

28. that's great. the leds that make up the cyclotron strip is actually an led ring. I would like the user to be able to control the number of leds in the ring and specify the which leds on the ring represent the location of each cyclotron light. perhaps we could define the first led that represents each light and then the code can take the NUM_LEDS_PER_LIGHT value to work out the subsequent leds to adjust?

29. that is good but the bacause we are defining the first led this has caused issues when we reverse the direction. can you change the code in a way that allows the user to define the leds that make up each cyclotron light AND this remains consistent when we reverse the direction

30. when I toggle the direction switch the lights clear to off as expected but the direction of the cyclotron lights do not change

31. can you change the number values for the corresponding variables in the code to the following:

#define NUM_LEDS 40  // Total number of LEDs in the ring
#define NUM_LEDS_PER_LIGHT 5  // Number of LEDs per cyclotron light

int cyclotronLightIndices[4][NUM_LEDS_PER_LIGHT] = {
  {0, 1, 2, 3, 4},      // LEDs for the first light
  {12, 13, 14, 15, 16},      // LEDs for the second light
  {22, 23, 24, 25, 26},  // LEDs for the third light
  {30, 31, 32, 33, 34}   // LEDs for the fourth light

  32. I would like to add another toggle switch that is connected to pin 6. I want the switch to be monitored in real time. if the pin is pulled low the code should run a "shutdown" animation. this is defined as: the 4 cyclotron lights should clear, immediately begin to fade up and down as a whole group, at the same time and back down to off. the timing of the fade should match the rotation animation fade. after that the code should wait for the pin 6 switch to go high again before running the "normal cyclotron rotation" animation

  33. can we continue with this code:

  34. I would like to add a third toggle switch called WandPWR on pin 8. I will define its function later

  35. I would like the code to work as a state machine. the first few states I would like to create are "Booting", "WandOn", "PackOn", "Shutdown" and "Off". the default state when the code starts is "Off". This state stops all other code from running. I want to monitor the SHUTDOWN_PIN and WAND_PWR_PIN pins in real time. when the WAND_PWR_PIN pin goes low I want the state to change to "WandOn". currently there is no functionality with this state. if the SHUTDOWN_PIN and WAND_PWR_PIN go low the state should change to "PackOn". in this state the code should run the normal cyclotron animation of the cyclotron lights. when the SHUTDOWN_PIN pin goes high the state should change to "Shutdown" and run the fade to off animation we previously created.

  36. can you change the SWITCH_PIN variable name to a clear name that explains its function

  37. can we reverse how the code is monitoring the high/low of the SHUTDOWN_PIN and the WAND_PWR_PIN pins

  38. I want to add another toggle switch on pin 9 called MovieToggle. this switch will only be read  at start up and will determine the movie version of the cyclotron lights animation that will be used until the Arduino physically has the power recycled. if the pin is high when the code if first run the animation used for the cyclotron lights will be exactly the same animations that we have already created. at the moment this would be the normal rotating cyclotron lights animation and the shutdown animation.this group of animations will be called 84 after the 1984 ghostbusters movie. if the pin is low when the code first runs the cyclotron lights will be run as a new group of animations called at the top level afterlife, after the 2021 movie ghostbusters: afterlife. we need to create two animations for the afterlife animations that are equivalent to the two animations we created for the 84 toggle option. before we change the code further does what I have said make sense to you?

  39. this looks good to me. lets create the equivilent animations for the after life animations. first we will define the animation that is the afterlife equivilent to the normal rotating cyclotron lights in the 84 animations group. using the value set in the NUM_LEDS variable see these leds as a ring. what we want to see is leds chasing around this defined ring. the direction of the chase will comply to the direction set in the DIRECTION_SWITCH_PIN variable value. the number of leds that chase around the ring should be a user definable variable. the speed of the chase should also be a user definable variable. I would like you to decide on an appropriate method to create a user definable variable for this value.

  40. I want to take the chase animation we just created and add a reduction in brightness across the defined led number in the NUM_CHASING_LEDS variable. the code should take in to account the direction of the chase, clockwise or anticlockwise.  the brightest led should therefore be the led at the front of the chase based on the defined direction. the least bright led should be the one furthest away from the front of the chase, as defined by the direction. the reduction in brightness should be linear and the user should have variable where they can define the values for the maximum and minimum brightness across the chase leds defined in NUM_CHASING_LEDS. does that make sense?

  41. the effect is close to what I wanted but the fade effect is in reverse. can you also make the default value for CHASE_SPEED to 250, NUM_CHASING_LEDS to 4 and MIN_BRIGHTNESS to 10

  42. I wish to add the direction of the cyclotron via DIRECTION_SWITCH_PIN pin to run just at start up exactly the same way the MOVIE_TOGGLE_PIN pin is

  43. I wish to add a second ring of ws2812 leds on pin pin 13. this will be know as the CyclotronCake. this will require user defined values equivalent to the current variables of NUM_LEDS, NUM_LEDS_PER_LIGHT and cyclotronLightIndices

  44. I now want to add a toggle switch on pin 13 called CyclotronLid. this will have two states CyclotronLidOn and CyclotronLidOff. the state of this pin should be monitored in real time. the pin should begin by being pulled high and this is equal to the CyclotronLidOff state. when the pin is pulled low this is equal to the CyclotronLidOn state. when the state is CyclotronLidOn the cyclotron animations should be sent to the ring connected to pin 2 and when the state is CyclotronLidOff the animation should be sent to the led ring connected to pin 3. does that make sense?

  45. can we change the CYCLON_LID_PIN pin to 11. that main functionality has worked but as the animation switches from one ring to another, the last leds on the previous ring remain in their last know state. i.e. still illuminated. we want those to clear to off when the animation switches between rings

  46. I have received a compiling error that NUM_LEDS_CAKE was not declared

  47. thank you that is working now as expected. is this a good point for us to look at the code to make it more efficient? I am thinking in regards of program storage and/or dynamic memory used.

  48. lets revert to this code:

  49. please use this code:

  50. can you list the features and functionality we have implemented so far please in the a list so I can track the projects progress

  51. can we comment out all the current serial debugging lines of the code but do not delete them please

  52. I want to now add the power cell to the code. before we do, can you explain to me what you understand to be the feature of the proton pack power cell from an the point of view that we need to create multiple animations to represent sates that we have already defined in the code for the proton pack. ideally match them to any film reference we can

  53. you have identify some good points. lets go through some of them to specify those feature that are a must and then start to define the animations for each of the current states we already have. the power cell is made up of 15 ws2812 leds and is blue in colour. I will be attaching the leds to the chain that makes up NUM_LEDS_CAKE on pin 3. it is important that the power cell lights are seen as its own independent group separate from the CyclotronCake. any changes we make must not effect the functions of the CyclotronCake animations as previously setup. the power cell lights must be able to run at the same time as any other functions running. when the pack is in the WandOn state the power cell leds group should be in the off state. for the idle state animation show me what you think it should be like based of the "simple up-and-down" suggestion you made. for this light group up and down are defined as, down toward the lowest number led in the chain and up is towards the higher number in the chain. for the shutdown state animation have the leds turn off one by one in the down direction as defined previously. for now just leave a placeholder for the booting animation. do you have any question about my description of the power cell?

  54. I have a compiling error that the powerCellLeds were not declared

  55. that was a good start. there is an issue with the power cell idle animation. when the cyclotron lights are running in the 84 idle animation the power cell motion keeps pausing however it runs smoothly and continuously when the cyclotron lights are running the afterlife idle animation

  56. I am still seeing the same unwonted behaviour as previously described

  57. can you examine this Arduino library and use it to create the same animation for our project please?

  58. ignore the last request. can you now reexamine the library. look at how the power cell only is being animated. identify and list the various states the power cell is connected to and each animation for those states. then describe to me in visual terms how each function works. also describe to me how long each of these functions take to reach their loop point

  59. rather than using the NeoPatterns Class etc, take your descriptions and convert them in the way you see fit. so recreate an equivalent in our project using whatever method you think best to replace and add to the appropriate power cell animations for our identified states. does that make sense?

  60. can you now give me that as part of our whole code

  61. I want to go back to the code before we started to add the powercell

  62. before we look at the power cell can you look at the code that controls the 84 animations and see if there are any changes we can make to the implementation that would help the code run better with other function simultaneously

  63. can you comment out all serial debugging lines of code

  64. the 84 idle animation now fades in on the first cycle do not fade out. so once the first cycle is complete all four of the cyclotron light are a contact on state

  65. that did not work. you have reenabled the debugging lines of code and the cyclotron lights appear to be fading but extremely slowly giving the appearance they are staying on in the solid sate after the first cycle

  66. use this code:

  67. what is the code using delays to do?

  68. which functions are using the delays in this code

  69. does the 84 idle animation use delays?

  70. the fade in and out is way to slow how can we fix this?

  71. can we add user variables for the fade in and fade out to make experimenting with the speed easier? can we use a variable that defines the time within which each fade should complete a fade up AND fade down?
